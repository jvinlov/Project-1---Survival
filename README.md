# Project-1---Survival

#Description
This is a game that combines strategy and chance.  Players choose an environment to start a civilization.  TThey are awarded a population of 20 people.  They are then given a certain amount of building credits to create buildings which have different building bonuses and different times to build.

As this timer is going on, a random natural disaster will spawn at a random time (after a certain interval).  The type of disaster will have different effects based on the environment.  Buildings will be destroyed and population will be destroyed at a certain rate.  This will be animated on the screen.

At the end of the disaster, the Poulation and Buildings score will be totaled. This will be stored as Player 1 score, and then Player 2 will go through a round and then compare the scores at the end of the round to determine the winner.
